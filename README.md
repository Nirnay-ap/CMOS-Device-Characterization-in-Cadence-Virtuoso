# CMOS-Device-Characterization-in-Cadence-Virtuoso


This project presents the DC and PVT analysis of NMOS and PMOS transistors 
using Cadence Virtuoso.

## Objectives
- Plot NMOS and PMOS input characteristics (Id vs Vgs / Vsg)
- Plot output characteristics (Id vs Vds / Vsd)
- Study the effect of:
  - Width and Length variation
  - Channel length scaling
  - Process, Voltage and Temperature (PVT) corners

## Tools Used
- Cadence Virtuoso
- Spectre Simulator

## Analyses Performed
- DC Analysis
- Parametric Sweep
- PVT Analysis

## Results
The project demonstrates how transistor current varies with:
- Geometry (W/L)
- Temperature
- Supply and bias conditions

These results are useful for understanding MOSFET behavior 
in analog and digital CMOS design.
